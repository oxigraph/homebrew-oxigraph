This Homebrew tag provides a `oxigraph` formula installing the [Oxigraph server](https://oxigraph.org/server/).

To use it run:
```bash
brew tap oxigraph/oxigraph
brew install oxigraph
```

This installs the `oxigraph_server` binary and make it available in `PATH`.

See [Oxigraph server documentation](https://oxigraph.org/server/) for more instructions.
